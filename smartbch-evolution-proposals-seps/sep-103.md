## 1.  Summary

This SEP proposes a mechanism to allow EOAs to call a set of pre-defined smart contracts with `delegatecall` semantics.

## 2.  Abstract

Currently, smartBCH only allows a smart contract to delegatecall another smart contract. To automate some operations, we need to allow EOAs to delegatecall some pre-defined smart contracts, which do not access in-contract persistent storage, i.e., have no SSTORE or SLOAD instructions.

## 3.  Motivation

This SEP will be used to solve the headache of approving SEP20 tokens. EOA delegators help EOAs to finish all these three tasks in one transaction: 1) approve one or more tokens to a contract X; 2) call the contract X; 3) revoke the remained allowances to the contract X.

## 4.  Status

This SEP is under draft.

## 5.  Specification

When a transaction's `to` address is one of the pre-defined smart contracts, execute the contract's bytecode in such a context inside which the ADDRESS instruction (opcode=0x30) returns the transaction's `from` address.
